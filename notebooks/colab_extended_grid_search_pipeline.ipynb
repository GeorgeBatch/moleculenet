By using a nonlinear kernel function (**radial basis function**), it learns a non-linear function in the original space that maps features to predicted values.\n","\n","- 3.5.4 **Random forests.** Random forests (RF) are ensemble prediction methods.(72) A random forest consists of many individual decision trees, each of which is trained on a subsampled version of the original dataset. The results for individual trees are averaged to provide output predictions for the full forest. Random forests can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Training a random forest can be computa- tionally intensive, so benchmarks only include random forest results for smaller datasets.\n","\n","- 3.5.5 **Gradient boosting.** Gradient boosting is another ensemble method consisting of individual decision trees.(73) In contrast to random forests, it builds relatively simple trees which are sequentially incorporated to the ensemble. In each step, a new tree is generated in a greedy manner to minimize loss function. A sequence of such “weak” trees are combined together into an additive model.
